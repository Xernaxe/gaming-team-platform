# Project Description:
## When I first started building this project I have used the UI design template provided by Chandan Singh for free on figma community.
## Shortly after I have finished implementing the home page, I've paused the development process in order to create the UI for the rest of the pages. Several UI/UX methods were used in order to achieve this, such as: Benchmarking, Product Strategy, Heuristic Evaluation.


## Project is still under development
## Tech stack:
### Next.Js
### React
### TypeScript
### Tailwind
### Sanity CMS (As to keep the scope of the project in check)
